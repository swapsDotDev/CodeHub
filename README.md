# CodeHub React - Complete

A Vite + React aggregator of 50+ online compilers and sandboxes.

## Features
- Live favicons fetched via Google's favicon service
- Bundled descriptions and categories for quick browsing
- Preview via iframe (note: many sites disallow embedding)

## Run locally
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Notes
- Some sites block embedding with X-Frame-Options; use the 'Open' button to open in a new tab.
- Favicons are fetched live; if a site changes its favicon, the app will reflect it.
